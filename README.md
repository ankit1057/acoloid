Hey there this is my first public project! The goal of this project is to create a 
selfmade Arduino (Breadboard Arduino) with an RGB LED on a small laboratory pcb.
With a little 3.3v Bluetooth Module (7.99â‚¬ on ebay) I will make the Arduino communicate to 
an Android App and change the color of the RGB LED.
